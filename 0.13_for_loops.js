/*Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true*/
var name = "";
console.log(name.length);
for (lcv = 0; lcv < name.length; lcv++; ) {
	console.log(name[lcv]) //console.log(name[0]) and then [this number is increased by one each loop]
}



var numDiv = "";
console.log(numDiv.length);
for (lcv = 0; lcv < name.length; lcv++; ) {
	console.log(name[lcv]) //console.log(name[0]) and then [this number is increased by one each loop]
}
